Many of the most popular starting locations are near public transit. Customers are likely starting their commute with public transit and finishing via Citi bike.

There are more subscribers than customers. Subscribing to the service could be more cost effective for the end user if they are using it to commute to and from work.



## Summary
In New York City the Citibike bike sharing service seems to be used the most by who like to bike for their daily commute. 

Since the ultimate goal is to create a bike sharing service in Des Moines Iowa additional visualizations should maybe compare New York to Des Moines. One visualization may be a map of Des Moines public transit to start looking at the best places for bike locations. 

Another useful visualization may be to a comparison of number of bikes and population in New York to get an idea of how many bikes would be needed.
